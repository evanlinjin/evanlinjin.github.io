# Notible Projects

## Skywire Mainnet

> Skywire is the next evolutionary step in the internet’s development and use. We want to break the  chokehold that internet service providers (ISPs) have on the market by giving the power back to the  people. We are doing this by providing a decentralized community-driven mesh network where users  themselves will own and control the network’s infrastructure. Our goal is to provide everyone with access  to fast, secure, private and reliable internet.
